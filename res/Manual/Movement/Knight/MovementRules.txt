A knight moves to one of the nearest squares not on the same rank, file, or diagonal. 
(This can be thought of as moving two squares horizontally then one square vertically, or moving one square horizontally then two squares verticallyâ€”i.e. in an "L" pattern.) 
The knight is not blocked by other pieces; it jumps to the new location.
