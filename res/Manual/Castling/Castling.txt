Castling consists of moving the king two squares towards a rook, then placing the rook on the other side of the king, adjacent to it. 
It is not allowed to move both king and rook in the same time, because "Each move must be played with one hand only."

Castling is only permissible if all of the following conditions hold:

The king and rook involved in castling must not have previously moved
There must be no pieces between the king and the rook
The king may not currently be under attack, nor may the king pass through or end up in a square that is under attack by an enemy piece (though the rook is permitted to be under attack and to pass over an attacked square)
The castling must be kingside or queenside as shown in the diagram.

An unmoved king and an unmoved rook of the same color on the same rank are said to have castling rights.
