Pawns have the most complex rules of movement:
A pawn moves straight forward one square, if that square is vacant. 
If it has not yet moved, a pawn also has the option of moving two squares straight forward, provided both squares are vacant. 
Pawns cannot move backwards.
The pawn is also involved in the two special moves en passant and promotion.
